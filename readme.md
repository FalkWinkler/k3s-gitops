# Template for deploying k3s backed by Flux
- [ingress-nginx](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/) - Kubernetes ingress controller used for a HTTP reverse proxy of Kubernetes ingresses

Highly opinionated template for deploying a single [k3s](https://k3s.io) cluster with [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) and [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) backed by [Flux](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/) and [SOPS](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/guides/mozilla-sops/).

The purpose here is to showcase how you can deploy an entire Kubernetes cluster and show it off to the world using the [GitOps](https://www.weave.works/blog/what-is-gitops-really) tool [Flux](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/). When completed, your Git repository will be driving the state of your Kubernetes cluster. In addition with the help of the [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.sops), [Terraform](https://github.com/carlpett/terraform-provider-sops) and [Flux](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/guides/mozilla-sops/) SOPS integrations you'll be able to commit Age encrypted secrets to your public repo.

## :wave:&nbsp; Introduction

The following components will be installed in your [k3s](https://k3s.io/) cluster by default. They are only included to get a minimum viable cluster up and running. You are free to add / remove components to your liking but anything outside the scope of the below components are not supported by this template.

Feel free to read up on any of these technologies before you get started to be more familiar with them.

_Additional applications include [hajimari](https://github.com/toboshii/hajimari), [error-pages](https://github.com/tarampampam/error-pages), [echo-server](https://github.com/Ealenn/Echo-Server), [system-upgrade-controller](https://github.com/rancher/system-upgrade-controller), [reflector](https://github.com/emberstack/kubernetes-reflector), and [reloader](https://github.com/stakater/Reloader)_
- [calico](https://www.tigera.io/project-calico/) - CNI (container network interface)
- [echo-server](https://github.com/Ealenn/Echo-Server) - REST Server Tests (Echo-Server) API (useful for debugging HTTP issues)
- [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) - Automatically configure external DNS servers for Kubernetes Ingresses and Services
- [flux](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/) - GitOps tool for deploying manifests from the `cluster` directory
- [hajimari](https://github.com/toboshii/hajimari) - start page with ingress discovery
- [k8s_gateway](https://github.com/ori-edge/k8s_gateway) - DNS resolver for all types of external Kubernetes resources
- [kube-vip](https://kube-vip.io/) - layer 2 load balancer for the Kubernetes control plane
- [local-path-provisioner](https://github.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner) - default storage class provided by k3s
- [metallb](https://metallb.universe.tf/) - bare metal load balancer
- [reloader](https://github.com/stakater/Reloader) - restart pods when Kubernetes `configmap` or `secret` changes
- [system-upgrade-controller](https://github.com/rancher/system-upgrade-controller) - upgrade k3s
- [traefik](https://traefik.io) - ingress controller

For provisioning the following tools will be used:

- [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download/server) - this is a pretty universal operating system that supports running all kinds of home related workloads in Kubernetes
- [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) - this will be used to provision the Ubuntu operating system to be ready for Kubernetes and also to install k3s
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io) - in order to help with the DNS settings this will be used to provision an already existing Cloudflare domain and DNS settings

## :memo:&nbsp; Prerequisites

### :computer:&nbsp; Systems

- One or more nodes with a fresh install of [Ubuntu Server 20.04](https://ubuntu.com/download/server). These nodes can be bare metal or VMs.
- A [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) account with a domain, this will be managed by Terraform.
- Some experience in debugging problems and a positive attitude ;)

### :warning:&nbsp; pre-commit

It is advisable to install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) and the pre-commit hooks that come with this repository.
[sops-pre-commit](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/sops-pre-commit) will check to make sure you are not by accident committing your secrets un-encrypted.

After pre-commit is installed on your machine run:

```sh
pre-commit install-hooks
```

## :open_file_folder:&nbsp; Repository structure

The Git repository contains the following directories under `cluster` and are ordered below by how Flux will apply them.

```sh
📁 cluster      # k8s cluster defined as code
├─📁 flux       # flux, gitops operator, loaded before everything
├─📁 crds       # custom resources, loaded before 📁 core and 📁 apps
├─📁 charts     # helm repos, loaded before 📁 core and 📁 apps
├─📁 config     # cluster config, loaded before 📁 core and 📁 apps
├─📁 core       # crucial apps, namespaced dir tree, loaded before 📁 apps
└─📁 apps       # regular apps, namespaced dir tree, loaded last
│   └── system-upgrade
```

## :rocket:&nbsp; Lets go!

Very first step will be to create a new repository by clicking the **Use this template** button on this page.

Clone the repo to you local workstation and `cd` into it.

:round_pushpin: **All of the below commands** are run on your **local** workstation, **not** on any of your cluster nodes.

### :closed_lock_with_key:&nbsp; Setting up Age

:round_pushpin: Here we will create a Age Private and Public key. Using SOPS with Age allows us to encrypt and decrypt secrets.

1. Create a Age Private / Public Key

```sh
age-keygen -o age.agekey
```

2. Set up the directory for the Age key and move the Age file to it

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/sops/age
mv age.agekey ~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt
```

3. Export the `SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE` variable in your `bashrc`, `zshrc` or `config.fish` and source it, e.g.

```sh
export SOPS_AGE_KEY_FILE=~/.config/sops/age/keys.txt
source ~/.bashrc
```

4. Fill out the Age public key in the `.config.env` under `BOOTSTRAP_AGE_PUBLIC_KEY`, **note** the public key should start with `age`...

### :cloud:&nbsp; Global Cloudflare API Key

In order to use Terraform and `cert-manager` with the Cloudflare DNS challenge you will need to create a API key.

1. Head over to Cloudflare and create a API key by going [here](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens).

2. Under the `API Keys` section, create a global API Key.

3. Use the API Key in the configuration section below.

### :page_facing_up:&nbsp; Configuration

:round_pushpin: The `.config.env` file contains necessary configuration files that are needed by Ansible, Terraform and Flux.

1. Copy the `.config.sample.env` to `.config.env` and start filling out all the environment variables. **All are required** and read the comments they will explain further what is required.

2. Once that is done, verify the configuration is correct by running `./configure.sh --verify`

3. If you do not encounter any errors run `./configure.sh` to start having the script wire up the templated files and place them where they need to be.

### :zap:&nbsp; Preparing Ubuntu with Ansible
1. Ensure you are able to SSH into your nodes from your workstation using a private SSH key **without a passphrase**. This is how Ansible is able to connect to your remote nodes.

:round_pushpin: Here we will be running a Ansible Playbook to prepare Ubuntu for running a Kubernetes cluster.

:round_pushpin: Nodes are not security hardened by default, you can do this with [dev-sec/ansible-collection-hardening](https://github.com/dev-sec/ansible-collection-hardening) or something similar.

1. Ensure you are able to SSH into you nodes from your workstation with using your private ssh key. This is how Ansible is able to connect to your remote nodes.

2. Install the deps by running `task ansible:deps`

3. Verify Ansible can view your config by running `task ansible:list`

4. Verify Ansible can ping your nodes by running `task ansible:adhoc:ping`

5. Finally, run the Ubuntu Prepare playbook by running `task ansible:playbook:ubuntu-prepare`

6. If everything goes as planned you should see Ansible running the Ubuntu Prepare Playbook against your nodes.

### :sailboat:&nbsp; Installing k3s with Ansible

:round_pushpin: Here we will be running a Ansible Playbook to install [k3s](https://k3s.io/) with [this](https://galaxy.ansible.com/xanmanning/k3s) wonderful k3s Ansible galaxy role. After completion, Ansible will drop a `kubeconfig` in `./provision/kubeconfig` for use with interacting with your cluster with `kubectl`.

1. Verify Ansible can view your config by running `task ansible:list`

2. Verify Ansible can ping your nodes by running `task ansible:adhoc:ping`

3. Run the k3s install playbook by running `task ansible:playbook:k3s-install`

4. If everything goes as planned you should see Ansible running the k3s install Playbook against your nodes.

5. Verify the nodes are online

```sh
kubectl --kubeconfig=./provision/kubeconfig get nodes
# NAME           STATUS   ROLES                       AGE     VERSION
# k8s-0          Ready    control-plane,master      4d20h   v1.21.5+k3s1
# k8s-1          Ready    worker                    4d20h   v1.21.5+k3s1
```

### :small_blue_diamond:&nbsp; GitOps with Flux

📍 Review the Terraform scripts under `./terraform/cloudflare/` and make sure you understand what it's doing (no really review it). If your domain already has existing DNS records be sure to export those DNS settings before you continue. Ideally you can update the terraform script to manage DNS for all records if you so choose to.

1. Pull in the Terraform deps by running `task terraform:init:cloudflare`

2. Review the changes Terraform will make to your Cloudflare domain by running `task terraform:plan:cloudflare`

3. Finally have Terraform execute the task by running `task terraform:apply:cloudflare`

If Terraform was ran successfully and you have port forwarded `80` and `443` in your router to the `${BOOTSTRAP_METALLB_TRAEFIK_ADDR}` IP, head over to your browser and you _should_ be able to access `https://hajimari.${BOOTSTRAP_CLOUDFLARE_DOMAIN}`!


:round_pushpin: Here we will be installing [flux](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/) after some quick bootstrap steps.

1. Verify Flux can be installed

```sh
    ```sh
    task cluster:verify
# ► checking prerequisites
# ✔ kubectl 1.21.5 >=1.18.0-0
# ✔ Kubernetes 1.21.5+k3s1 >=1.16.0-0
# ✔ prerequisites checks passed
```

2. Push you changes to git


    kubectl --kubeconfig=./provision/kubeconfig \
    -n flux-system create secret generic sops-age \
    --from-file=age.agekey=/dev/stdin
5. If you verified all the secrets are encrypted, you can delete the `tmpl` directory now

6.  Push you changes to git

```sh
git add -A
    git commit -m "Initial commit :rocket:"
git push
```

3. Install Flux and sync the cluster to the Git repository

```sh
    task cluster:install
# namespace/flux-system configured
# customresourcedefinition.apiextensions.k8s.io/alerts.notification.toolkit.fluxcd.io created
# unable to recognize "./cluster/base/flux-system": no matches for kind "Kustomization" in version "kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta1"
# unable to recognize "./cluster/base/flux-system": no matches for kind "GitRepository" in version "source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta1"
# unable to recognize "./cluster/base/flux-system": no matches for kind "HelmRepository" in version "source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta1"
# unable to recognize "./cluster/base/flux-system": no matches for kind "HelmRepository" in version "source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta1"
# unable to recognize "./cluster/base/flux-system": no matches for kind "HelmRepository" in version "source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta1"
```

4. Verify Flux components are running in the cluster

```sh
kubectl --kubeconfig=./provision/kubeconfig get pods -n flux-system
# NAME                                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
# helm-controller-5bbd94c75-89sb4            1/1     Running   0          1h
# kustomize-controller-7b67b6b77d-nqc67      1/1     Running   0          1h
# notification-controller-7c46575844-k4bvr   1/1     Running   0          1h
# source-controller-7d6875bcb4-zqw9f         1/1     Running   0          1h
```

🎉 **Congratulations** if all goes smooth you'll have a Kubernetes cluster managed by Flux, your Git repository is driving the state of your cluster.

Now it's time to pause and go get some coffee ☕ because next is describing how DNS is handled. 🧠

:round_pushpin: Review the Terraform scripts under `./terraform/cloudflare/` and make sure you understand what it's doing (no really review it). If your domain already has existing DNS records be sure to export those DNS settings before you continue. Ideally you can update the terraform script to manage DNS for all records if you so choose to.

### 🌐 DNS

📍 The `external-dns` application created in the `networking` namespace will handle creating public DNS records. `echo-server` is the only public domain exposed on your Cloudflare domain. In order to make additional applications public you must set an ingress annotation like in the `HelmRelease` for `echo-server`. You do not need to use Terraform to create additional DNS records unless you a record outside the purposes of your Kubernetes cluster.

`k8s_gateway` is deployed on the IP choosen for `${BOOTSTRAP_METALLB_K8S_GATEWAY_ADDR}`. Inorder to test DNS you can point your clients DNS to the `${BOOTSTRAP_METALLB_K8S_GATEWAY_ADDR}` IP address and load `https://hajimari.${BOOTSTRAP_CLOUDFLARE_DOMAIN}` in your browser.

You can also try debugging with the command `dig`, e.g. `dig @${BOOTSTRAP_METALLB_K8S_GATEWAY_ADDR} hajimari.${BOOTSTRAP_CLOUDFLARE_DOMAIN}` and you should get a valid answer containing your `${BOOTSTRAP_METALLB_INGRESS_ADDR}` IP address.

If your router (or Pi-Hole, Adguard Home or whatever) supports conditional DNS forwarding (also know as split-horizon DNS) you may have DNS requests for `${SECRET_DOMAIN}` only point to the  `${BOOTSTRAP_METALLB_K8S_GATEWAY_ADDR}` IP address. This will ensure only DNS requests for `${SECRET_DOMAIN}` will get routed to your `k8s_gateway` service.

To access services from the outside world port forwarded `80` and `443` in your router to the `${BOOTSTRAP_METALLB_INGRESS_ADDR}` IP, in a few moments head over to your browser and you _should_ be able to access `https://echo-server.${BOOTSTRAP_CLOUDFLARE_DOMAIN}` from a device outside your LAN.

Now if nothing is working, that is expected. This is DNS after all!

### 🔐 SSL

By default in this template Kubernetes ingresses are set to use the [Let's Encrypt Staging Environment](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/staging-environment/). This will hopefully reduce issues from ACME on requesting certificates until you are ready to use this in "Production".

Once you have confirmed there are no issues requesting your certificates replace `letsencrypt-staging` with `letsencrypt-production` in your ingress annotations for `cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer`

[Renovatebot](https://www.mend.io/free-developer-tools/renovate/) will scan your repository and offer PRs when it finds dependencies out of date. Common dependencies it will discover and update are Flux, Ansible Galaxy Roles, Terraform Providers, Kubernetes Helm Charts, Kubernetes Container Images, Pre-commit hooks updates, and more!
### 🪝 Github Webhook

Flux is pull-based by design meaning it will periodically check your git repository for changes, using a webhook you can enable Flux to update your cluster on `git push`. In order to configure Github to send `push` events from your repository to the Flux webhook receiver you will need two things:

1. Webhook URL
    Your webhook receiver will be deployed on `https://flux-receiver.${BOOTSTRAP_CLOUDFLARE_DOMAIN}/hook/:hookId`. In order to find out your hook id you can run the following command:

    ```sh
    kubectl -n flux-system get receiver/github-receiver --kubeconfig=./provision/kubeconfig
    # NAME              AGE    READY   STATUS
    # github-receiver   6h8m   True    Receiver initialized with URL: /hook/12ebd1e363c641dc3c2e430ecf3cee2b3c7a5ac9e1234506f6f5f3ce1230e123
    ```

    So if my domain was `k8s-at-home.com` the full url would look like this:

    ```text
    https://flux-receiver.k8s-at-home.com/hook/12ebd1e363c641dc3c2e430ecf3cee2b3c7a5ac9e1234506f6f5f3ce1230e123
    ```

2. Webhook secret
    Your webhook secret can be found by decrypting the `secret.sops.yaml` using the following command:

    ```sh
    sops -d ./cluster/apps/flux-system/webhooks/github/secret.sops.yaml | yq .stringData.token
    ```

    **Note:** Don't forget to update the `BOOTSTRAP_FLUX_GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET` variable in your `.config.env` file so it matches the generated secret if applicable

Now that you have the webhook url and secret, it's time to set everything up on the Github repository side. Navigate to the settings of your repository on Github, under "Settings/Webhooks" press the "Add webhook" button. Fill in the webhook url and your secret.
